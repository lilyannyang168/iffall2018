<h2>Carmen's Feedback</h2>

<p>
Camrne suggests a darker color scheme, since the pictures will be brighter. <br>
Make sure the pictures are well-lit and not too distracting from the text.  <br>
Center everything so that there's not a big disparity between pictures and text.  <br>
List ingredients in one column.  <br>
Make sure to space out the numbered lines.  <br>
Add how long it takes to prepare and how many servings it is.  <br>
Be careful of font size.  <br>
</p>

<h2>Claire's Feedback</h2>

<p>
Claire suggests to put ingredients on one column. <br>
Keep the images in between steps. <br>
Put "Japanese" before "fluffy pancakes" to clarify. <br>
I can take inspiration from the video for color choices. <br>
