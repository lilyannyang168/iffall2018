<h1>Initial Meeting Notes</h1>

<ol>


<li>Do want a timeline, however you want to represent it (diagram, words, etc.) </li>
<li>For historical representation, should have at least one image of the original footage of police getting at Rodney King</li>
<li>Maybe warnings for images that some people may find distressing</li>
<li>Color scheme = maybe red? A lot of color from images, so for text and boxes, do whatever I want</li>
<li>Also in resources, would like added
	-LA 92 documentary by National Geographic
	-Gook by Justin Chon</li>
<li>Resources for me
