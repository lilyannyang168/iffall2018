<div class="text">
<p>Many Korean Americans in Los Angeles refer to the event as Sa-I-Gu, meaning “four-two-nine”in Korean, in reference to April 29, 1992, which was the day the riots started. The week of riots following the acquittal of the LAPD officers in the beating of Rodney King has been considered a major turning point for the development of a distinct Korean American identity and community.</p>

<p>Over 2,300 mom-and-pop shops run by Korean business owners were damaged through ransacking and looting during the riots, sustaining close to $400 million in damages. Media coverage has framed the looting and destruction as a result of growing social and economic tensions between the Korean American and African American communities, with some attributing the tensions to the Middleman minority theory where friction arises when a minority group has a role as a “middleman”; such as a retailer or business owner between a more dominant majority and another minority group.</p>

<p>According to Edward Park the 1992 violence stimulated a new wave of political activism among
Korean-Americans, but it also split them into two camps. The liberals sought to unite with other
minorities in Los Angeles to fight against racial oppression and scapegoating. The conservatives
emphasized law and order and generally favored the economic and social policies of the Republican
Party. The conservatives tended to emphasize the political differences between Koreans and other
minorities, specifically African Americans.</p>

<p>An article from the Los Angeles Times on June 18, 1991 highlights the growing violence prior to the
riots. "Other recent incidents include the May 25 shooting of two employees in a liquor store near
35th Street and Central Avenue. The victims, both recent emigrants from Korea, were killed after
complying with robbery demands made by an assailant described by police as an African-American.
Last Thursday, an African-American man suspected of committing a robbery in an auto parts store
on Manchester Avenue was fatally wounded by his accomplice, who accidentally fired a shotgun
round during a struggle with the shop's Korean-American owner. "This violence is disturbing too,""
store owner Park said. ""But who cries for these victims?"</p>

<p>On March 16, 1991, a year prior to the Los Angeles riots, storekeeper Soon Ja Du physically
confronted black ninth-grader Latasha Harlins, grabbing her sweater and backpack when she

suspected she had been trying to steal a bottle of orange juice from Empire Liquor, the store Du's
family owned in Compton. After Latasha hit Du, Du shot her in the back of the head, killing her.
(Security tape showed the girl, already dead, was clutching $2 in her hand when investigators
arrived.) Du was convicted of voluntary manslaughter and forced to pay a fine of $500, but not
sentenced to any prison time. Relations between the African-American and Korean communities
significantly worsened after this, and the former became increasingly mistrustful of the criminal
justice system. Racial tensions had been simmering for years between these groups. Many African
Americans were angry toward a growing Korean migrant community in South Central Los Angeles
earning a living in their communities, and felt disrespected and humiliated by many Korean
merchants. Cultural differences and a language barrier further fueled tensions. The probation Du
received for killing Latasha Harlins, combined with the acquittal of the four LAPD officers in Rodney
King's trial, resulted in the ensuing Los Angeles riots, with much anger directed at Koreans.</p>

<p>Television coverage of two Korean merchants firing pistols repeatedly at roving looters was widely
seen and controversial. The New York Times said "that the image seemed to speak of race war, and
of vigilantes taking the law into their own hands." The merchants were reacting to the shooting of
Mr. Park's wife and her sister by looters who had converged on the shopping center where the shops
were located.</p>

<p>Due to their low social status and the language barrier with immigrants, Korean Americans received
very little if any aid or protection from police authorities. David Joo, a manager of the gun store,
said, "I want to make it clear that we didn't open fire first. At that time, four police cars were there.
Somebody started to shoot at us. The LAPD ran away in half a second. I never saw such a fast
escape. I was pretty disappointed."" Carl Rhyu, also a participant in the Koreans' armed response,
said,</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>"If it was your own business and your own property, would you be willing to trust it to someone else?
We are glad the National Guard is here. They're good backup. But when our shops were burning we
called the police every five minutes; no response."</p>
</div>

<p>At a shopping center several miles north of Koreatown, Jay Rhee, who said he and others fired five
hundred shots into the ground and air, said, "We have lost our faith in the police. Where were you
when we needed you?" Koreatown was isolated from South Central Los Angeles, yet despite this, it
was the most severely damaged in the riots.</p>

<h3>Hispanics in the Riots</h3>

<p>According to a report prepared in 1993 by the Latinos Futures Research Group for the Latino
Coalition for a New Los Angeles, one third of those who were killed and one half of those who were
arrested in the riots were Latino; moreover, between 20% and 40% of the businesses that were
looted were owned by Latino owners. Hispanics were considered a minority despite their
increasing numbers, and thus lacked political support and were poorly represented. Their lack of
knowledge, both socially and politically, within the area additionally silenced their acknowledgment of
participation. Many of the individuals of the area were new immigrants; they often did not speak
English and were seen as unimportant and "different" from blacks.</p>

<p>Gloria Alvarez claims the riots did not create social distance between Hispanics and black people,
but rather united them. Although the riots were perceived in different aspects, Alvarez argues it
brought a greater sense of understanding between Hispanics and blacks. Even though Hispanics
now heavily populate the area that was once predominantly black, such transition has improved over
time. The building of a stronger and more understanding community could help to prevent social
chaos arising between the two groups. Hate crimes and widespread violence between the two
groups continue to be a problem in the L.A. area, however.</p>
