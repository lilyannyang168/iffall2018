<h1>Postcard Feedback for Andrew</h1>

<ol>


<li>The quotes are all pretty quirky and humorous, but I'm not sure how much they relate to each other. They're all part of different entities and Archer is a drawn character. Archer's quote is also the odd one out, because quote #2 and #3 convey similar personalities. I would replace Archer with a real life person to make it more consistent, and use a quote that relates better with the other two. </li>
<li>Another option is to take out Cody Ko(who is a Youtuber) and put in another TV character. This way all three come from TV shows. Either way just make the three more consistent.  </li>
<li>The black and white text colors are fitting. I would explore more typefaces. </li>
<li>The phone version for Mac's quote looks kind of awkward because his name is on the right by itself. I would just put his name under the quote and make the width of the quote wider.</li>
<li>Lack of quotation marks on the second quote.</li>
<li>The way Archer's name is small in the mobile version works pretty nicely. You can incorporate that into the other ones. </li>
<li>Also be consistent with how you credit the quotes. Archer's is just "Archer". Cody's is "- Cody". Mac's is "- Mac -". So try to choose one and go with it. </li>
